# Hr-Analysis
This HR Analytics project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand attrition trends and workforce behavior. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I identified key factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, salary, and promotions that influence employee turnover and provided data-driven insights to improve retention.

HR Analytics Project – Detailed Insights & KPIs

This HR Analytics project focused on understanding employee attrition patterns using key workforce metrics and KPIs. The analysis revealed that attrition is driven by a combination of job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, promotion timelines, and tenure, rather than a single factor.

One of the strongest indicators of attrition was Job Satisfaction. Employees with lower satisfaction scores showed a significantly higher Attrition Rate, indicating disengagement and misalignment between roles and expectations. This highlights the importance of monitoring satisfaction metrics as an early warning signal.

Work-Life Balance emerged as another critical factor. Employees reporting poor work-life balance consistently showed higher attrition across multiple departments. This suggests that workload distribution and flexibility directly impact employee retention and overall workforce stability.

The analysis of Promotion Waiting Time revealed that employees who waited longer for promotions had a higher likelihood of leaving the organization. Limited career growth opportunities increased turnover risk, making promotion cycle tracking an important HR KPI.

From a departmental and role-based perspective, attrition was not evenly distributed. Certain departments and job roles experienced higher attrition rates, especially among employees with shorter tenure. This indicates early-stage disengagement and the need for stronger onboarding and support mechanisms.

Compensation analysis showed that salary differences influenced attrition in specific roles, where lower salary bands were associated with higher employee turnover. This highlights the importance of compensation benchmarking and role-based salary fairness.

Key KPIs Used :

1. Attrition Rate
2. Average Employee Tenure
3. Job Satisfaction Score
4. Promotion Waiting Time
5. Attrition by Department & Job Role
6. Salary Band vs Attrition

Overall, the project demonstrates how HR KPIs and dashboards can be used to identify attrition drivers and support data-driven retention strategies, improved workforce planning, and better HR decision-making.
